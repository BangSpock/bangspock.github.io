      Want to bang Spock but aren't entirely sure where to start? Are you
      worried you won't be able to please him? Are you worried he won't live up
      to the fantasy in your head? Why not head over to the Enterprise for some
      words of advice for people who have been there, done that, done it again,
      done it from behind, done it upside down, and lived to tell the tale?

          I have banged Spock a number of times in my day, once the cameras were
          off. Long nights on the ship, you know. I never was into brunettes
          before but something about the bulge in his pants really drew me in.
          Spock was surprisingly sensual, and really loved the pounding I gave
          him. If I was to give you one piece of advice... I'd tell you to grab
          his balls if he's getting a little too riled up.... If he isn't riled
          up enough, pop one in your mouth!

          Banging Spock is an intricate interplay of respect for Vulcan customs
          and appreciation for our shared experiences. As captain, I have
          learned that such a gesture must convey warmth and camaraderie, while
          also acknowledging his preference for emotional restraint. It is also
          very very important to remember that just like all Vulcans, Spock will
          only allow anal on Wednesdays, Thursdays, days he is stressed, days I
          am stressed, and special occasions. If the occasion arises, let the
          embrace reflect the profound respect and bond we share, reinforcing
          the unity aboard the starship Enterprise. Spock once asked me if he
          could ejaculate on my head, and I said "Yes. Make it so."

          I banged Spock once and only once, and I approached him the only way I
          know how - like a warrior. I was raised by humans, and they taught me
          the art of pleasing a man. Spock is no different. I cupped his ass and
          he cupped mine, and I wish to otherwise remain silent on the matter.

          I used to think of Spock as a friend and confidant. I am an Android
          with Human-like Abilities, and Spock selfishly harnessed my power to
          make me a living, breathing, gyrating, vibrating dildo with hands, a
          tongue, a heart that can sing and break, and feelings. Spock became
          addicted to my cock and overrode my software so that I could bang him
          even when I was asleep - or as asleep as an android can be while a 185
          lb Vulan bounces up and down the length of your cold shaft. If I would
          give you a tip - I would remind you to not get too attached. Spock may
          seem like he can't live without your embrace, but some other creature
          will come along soon enough and tempt his sphincter away. Take advice
          from me - protect yourself.

          Ah, banging Mr. Spock, it vas quite an interesting adventure, I tell
          you! His Vulcan ways and logical mind might make it seem like hugging
          a stern star, but deep down, I believe he has a hidden soft spot. I
          believe you Americans call it ze prostate? To taste him vas like
          discovering a new planet, full of surprises and mysteries. Just be
          ready for the raised eyebrow, da, that's his vay of saying he secretly
          appreciates the sensations, in his own, logical vay, of course! I vas
          hoping Spock would eventually become, like your Borat says, MY WIFE,
          but he declined. I still search for another that can satisfy me like
          him.
